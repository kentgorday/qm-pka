"""Quasi-RRHO thermochemistry from harmonic frequencies.

Implements Grimme's quasi-rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator (quasi-RRHO)
approach (Grimme, Chem. Eur. J. 2012, 18, 9955) for computing free
energy corrections from vibrational frequencies. Low-frequency modes
are interpolated between harmonic oscillator and free rotor treatments
using a damping function, avoiding the divergent entropy contributions
that plague standard RRHO at low frequencies.

    """Compute the vibrational free energy correction using quasi-RRHO.

    Uses Grimme's interpolation between harmonic oscillator and free
    rotor for low-frequency modes (below `cutoff` cm⁻¹).

    Harmonic frequencies are scaled to correct for systematic
    overestimation vs experiment (Kesharwani, Brauer, Martin, J. Phys.
    Chem. A 2015, 119, 1701).  Separate scale factors are applied to
    the ZPVE and thermal (enthalpy + entropy) contributions.

    Args:
        frequencies_cm: Vibrational frequencies in cm⁻¹.  Must contain
            only true vibrational modes (translational and rotational
            modes should already be projected out by the QM backend).
            Imaginary frequencies (negative values) are treated as real
            using their absolute value.
        temperature: Temperature in Kelvin.
        cutoff: Frequency cutoff for quasi-RRHO damping in cm⁻¹.
        pressure: Pressure in Pa (for translational entropy, unused here
            since we only compute vibrational contributions).
        scale_zpve: Scale factor for ZPVE contributions (~0.98 for
            modern functionals with sufficient basis sets).
        scale_thermal: Scale factor for thermal enthalpy and entropy
            contributions (~0.96 for modern functionals).

    Returns:
        Vibrational free energy correction in Hartree.
        This is G_vib = ZPE + H_vib(T) - T*S_vib(T), where S_vib
