    Kept, rather than dropped, so that a run records what it could not compute:
    the geometry is inspectable and the reason is explicit, instead of the
    conformer simply being absent with only a log line on someone's terminal.

    Deliberately *not* a `Conformer`: it has no ``free_energy``, so it cannot be
    summed into a partition function by accident. That matters because the
    failures collected here are ones where a partially-computed energy would
    look entirely plausible -- a conformer missing its RRHO term sits ~76
    kcal/mol below its siblings and would capture the whole charge state.

    ``multiplicity`` is the number of physical states lost, not one. Refinement
    deduplicates before computing Hessians, so a representative may already
    stand for several collapsed structures, and excluding it discards all of
    them. The non-representatives were discarded at deduplication, so no
    substitute can be promoted; recording the multiplicity at least makes the
    size of the loss visible rather than understating it. Falling back to a
    surviving duplicate would need deduplication to retain the whole group --
    deferred, since no Hessian failed across 941 conformers in the first batch.

    Whatever energy components were computed before the failure are retained
    for diagnosis.
