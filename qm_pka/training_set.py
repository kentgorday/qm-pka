"""Reading experimental pKa labels from a training-set CSV.

The `pkas` column mixes two label conventions, and which transition a value
refers to is carried by the *label*, never by the column order or by
`acid_base`:

* ``pKa{n}``  is the n-th proton lost starting from the neutral molecule, so
  ``pKa1`` is q=0 -> q=-1 and ``pKa2`` is q=-1 -> q=-2.
* ``pKaH{n}`` is the n-th proton lost starting from the fully protonated form,
  so ``pKaH1`` is q=+1 -> q=0 and ``pKaH2`` is q=+2 -> q=+1.

Two of the forty training entries mix them -- ``perrin3032``
(``pKa1=10.804;pKaH1=4.373``) and ``perrin3287``
(``pKa1=10.640;pKaH1=1.952``) -- and for those, pairing values with transitions
by position assigns a q=0 -> q=-1 measurement to the q=+1 -> q=0 transition and
reports a number that means nothing. Parse the label.
