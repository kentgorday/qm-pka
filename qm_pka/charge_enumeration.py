"""Broad SMARTS-based protonation/deprotonation enumeration with BFS.

Design principle: keep SMARTS simple and general (match any heteroatom with
the right H-count/charge), not substructure-specific. Generate more variants
rather than fewer — downstream QM energetics filter unrealistic states.

The table is closed under reversal: every deprotonation has a protonation that
undoes it, so a species can be walked back to where it came from. Note that P is
covered only as phosphine <-> phosphide; there is no phosphonium path in either
direction, which is a coverage gap rather than an asymmetry.

Both sides of every rule pin the hydrogen count *and* the formal charge. An
RDKit product template inherits any property it does not state, so a product
written ``[NH2:1]`` keeps the reactant's charge: ``[NH3+:1]>>[NH2:1]`` yields
an [NH2+] whose net charge never reaches the target, and the rule silently
never fires. Every rule that neutralises an ion has that shape, so leaving the
charge implicit disables exactly the half of the table needed to walk a charged
input back toward neutral.
