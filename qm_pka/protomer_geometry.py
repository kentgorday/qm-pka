"""Protomer identity read off a 3D geometry, and repair of migrated conformers.

`rdkit_utils.protomer_key` answers "which species is this?" from a SMILES.
This module answers it from coordinates, so that a conformer whose proton moved
during minimisation can be recognised and re-filed under the species it actually
became.  Migration is not rare: across the first training batch, 20 of 380
microstates changed protonation between xTB sampling and DFT refinement, and
nothing detected it.

Ownership is decided by *nearest heavy atom*, with no distance cutoff.  Two
properties make that sufficient:

* It is a deterministic function of the coordinates, so the same geometry always
  yields the same answer.  Where the answer changes, the geometry changed.
* Where a proton is genuinely shared, the two candidates are chemically alike,
  and when they are alike by graph automorphism -- the two oxygens of a
  carboxylate, the two ends of maleate -- `MolToSmiles` on the H-pinned skeleton
  canonicalises over the choice, so both assignments name the same species and
  the ambiguity has no consequence.

The residual case is a proton shared between *inequivalent* heavy atoms, where
the choice is arbitrary and does not cancel.  It is left arbitrary on purpose:
`charge_state_free_energy` sums flatly over every conformer of every microstate,
so which microstate holds a conformer changes the free energy only through
`Microstate.includes_enantiomer` -- at most kT ln 2 = 0.41 kcal/mol, about 0.3
pKa units, and only if the two candidates disagree on that flag.  The band is
also narrow: over 2890 refined conformers the median margin between first and
second nearest heavy atom is 0.9 A, and 0.55% sit within 0.2 A of a tie.
`ProtonAssignment.min_margin` records the margin for diagnosis; nothing branches
on it, so there is no threshold here to tune.

Stereochemistry is deliberately *not* part of the key.  Re-perceiving it would
mean reading stereo off a geometry through a template whose bond orders the
migration has just invalidated.  Microstates that share a protonation key and
differ only in configuration are therefore indistinguishable here; see
`repair_migrated_conformers` for how that case is resolved.

    The two sampling approaches diverge on what to do when no existing

    In approach 1 the set is *prescribed*: the enumerator decided which species
    are modelled, every microstate carries a known SMILES, and a geometry
    outside that set is an anomaly we cannot label without perceiving bond
    orders from coordinates -- so it is excluded, not dropped, and the run
    records what it could not place.  In approach 2 the set is *discovered*:
    microstates are defined by the hydrogen distribution read off the geometry
    in the first place, so an unseen distribution is not an anomaly at all and a
    new microstate is created for it.

    Runs before deduplication, so a conformer that lands beside an identical
